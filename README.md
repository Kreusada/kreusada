## 🛠️ What I Do

Most of my development time is spent discovering and innovating new ways to bijectively transform data. Public
examples of this include [Phonochrome](https://github.com/Kreusada/Phonochrome) and [OceanScript](https://github.com/Kreusada/OceanScript). 
I also spend a lot of time creating third party plugins for the 
[Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/tree/V3/develop) project. These are written on my
[Kreusada-Cogs](https://github.com/Kreusada/Kreusada-Cogs) repository. Aside from creating my own plugins, I am a member of the
[Cog-Creators](https://github.com/orgs/Cog-Creators) organisation and work in and around their friendly and knowledgeable
[community](https://discord.gg/red) and for their various repositories.

Some of my favorite tools and technologies:
- Programming languages: Python, JavaScript, C++
- Frameworks/Libraries: discord.py, redbot, bs4, pillow, spaCy, re, aiohttp
