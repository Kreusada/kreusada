## Kreusada

I am a footballer (right-winger) and athlete, specializing in 100m/200m sprints (11.5s PR).
Kreusada is a superhero name I made up as a kid, and has stuck with ever since.

I joined Discord and Github to study and develop code - it's a hobby I've gained from being stuck in the pandemic.

Any issues on my repo(s), feel free to reach out.
