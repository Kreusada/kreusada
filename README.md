# About me

Hi, I'm Kreusada and I maintain a collection of open source community plugins available to use for instances of [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot).

My main language is python, which I initially started learning back in 2017. I started using the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) framework in the summer of 2020, and then interacting with the [Red](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) framework into the autumn months of that same year. I then became a cog creator on the 26th of February 2021, and have continued to create plugins for the community.

I'd say my expertise in python is working with types, classes, and numerical data. Something that I wanted to work on was working more with asyncio to create and manage tasks, and to understand how they work. I'm interested in working with bitwise operators, and bytearrays, memoryviews. I also LOVE esoteric python :P

As for other languages, I'm fairly confident in batch, and I am currently learning Scala/Kojo!

Aside from development, my interests are football (‚öΩ), running, and socializing. I play as a right-winger, and I have broke various records in my area for 100/200m sprints. üòè
